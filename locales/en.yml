    blacklist:
      main: "Blacklist"
      help: |-
        Want to restrict certain words or sentences in your group?

        Blacklists are used to stop certain triggers from being said in a group. Any time the trigger is mentioned, that message will immediately be deleted.
        A good combo is sometimes to pair this up with warn filters!
        **NOTE:** blacklists do not affect group admins.
        Ã— /blacklist: View the current blacklisted words.

        **Admin only:**
        Ã— /addblacklist `<triggers>`: Add a trigger to the blacklist. Each line is considered one trigger, so using different lines will allow you to add multiple triggers.
        Ã— /unblacklist `<triggers>`: Remove triggers from the blacklist. Same newline logic applies here, so you can remove multiple triggers at once.
        Ã— /blaction `<action>`: This action will occur when user uses a blacklist word. Choose from - 'kick', 'ban', 'mute', 'warn'.
        Default is 'none', which will delete the users message on typing a blacklist word.

        **Owner Only**
        Ã— /rmallblacklist: Removes all the blacklists from the current chat.

        **Note:** Can only add or remove one blacklist at a time!

        **Example:**
        `/addblacklist hello`: this adds the word 'hello' as blacklist in the chat.
    filters:
      main: "Filters"
      help: |-
        â€¢ /filters: List all active filters saved in the chat.

        **Admin only:**
        â€¢ /filter "`<keyword>`" `<reply message>`: Add a filter to this chat. The bot will now reply that message whenever 'keyword'
        is mentioned. If you reply to a sticker with a keyword, the bot will reply with that sticker.

        If you want your keyword to be a sentence, use quotes. eg: /filter "hey there" How are you doin?
        **Example:**
        `/filter "filtername" Reply Text`

        Aliases for filters can be too set, just put '|' between the filternames you want.
        **Example:**
        `/filter "filtername1|filtername2" Reply Text`
        Using the you can make a single filter work on 2 filternames without manually adding another one.

        â€¢ /stop `<filter keyword>`: Stop that filter.
        **Note:** For filters with aliases, if you stop one alias, the filter will stop working on other aliases too.
        **For Example:** If you stop the "filtername1" from above example, the bot will not respond to "filtername2".

        **Chat creator only:**
        â€¢ /removeallfilters: Remove all chat filters at once.

        **Note:**
        Currently there is a limit of 50 filters and 120 aliases per chat.
        All filter keywords are in lowercase.

      You can format your message using **bold**, __italics__, --underline--, and much more. Go ahead and experiment!

      <b>Supported markdown</b>:
      - <code>`code words`</code>: Backticks are used for monospace fonts. Shows as: <code>code words</code>.
      - <code>__italic words__</code>: Underscores are used for italic fonts. Shows as: <i>italic words</i>.
      - <code>**bold words**</code>: Asterisks are used for bold fonts. Shows as: <b>bold words</b>.
      - <code>~~strikethrough~~</code>: Tildes are used for strikethrough. Shows as: <strike>strikethrough</strike>.
      - <code>[hyperlink](example.com)</code>: This is the formatting used for hyperlinks. Shows as: <a href="https://example.com/">hyperlink</a>.
      - <code>[My Button](buttonurl://example.com)</code>: This is the formatting used for creating buttons. This example will create a button named "My button" which opens <code>example.com</code> when clicked.
      If you would like to send buttons on the same row, use the <code>:same</code> formatting.

      <b>Example:</b>
      <code>[button 1](buttonurl://example.com)</code>
      <code>[button 2](buttonurl://example.com:same)</code>
      <code>[button 3](buttonurl://example.com)</code>
      This will show button 1 and 2 on the same line, with 3 underneath.

      <b>Fillings</b>

      You can also customise the contents of your message with contextual data. For example, you could mention a user by name in the welcome message, or mention them in a filter!
      You can use these to mention a user in notes too!

      <b>Supported fillings:</b>
      - <code>{first}</code>: The user's first name.
      - <code>{last}</code>: The user's last name.
      - <code>{fullname}</code>: The user's full name.

      - <code>{id}</code>: The user's ID.
      - <code>{chatname}</code>: The chat's name.
    random_help: |-
      <b>Random Content</b>

      Another thing that can be fun, is to randomise the contents of a message. Make things a little more personal by changing welcome messages, or changing notes!

      How to use random contents:
      - %%%: This separator can be used to add "random" replies to the bot.
      For example:
      <code>hello
      %%%
      how are you</code>
      This will randomly choose between sending the first message, "hello", or the second message, "how are you".
      Use this to make Alita feel a bit more customised! (only works in filters/notes)

      Example welcome message::
      - Every time a new user joins, they'll be presented with one of the three messages shown here.
      -> /filter "hey"
      hello there <code>{first}</code>!
      %%%
      Ooooh, <code>{first}</code> how are you?
      %%%
      Sup? <code>{first}</code>
